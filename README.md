# Capstone I: Mashable Article Popularity
### Springboard - Data Science Career Track
 
## Introduction
This repository contains my analysis of Mashable article shares in order to determine what qualities add to the popularity of online articles. Recently I’ve decided I want to scrape all of the data myself as well as create many of the features found in the original `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv`, only keeping the URLs and article shares. 
 
## The Data
The dataset `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv` was found using the [University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and was created by [Kelwin Fernandes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283510525_A_Proactive_Intelligent_Decision_Support_System_for_Predicting_the_Popularity_of_Online_News) for a study on online news popularity done at the University of Porto, Portugal. Using the URls from this dataset, I used web-scraping to collect the text as well as bits of information from the metadata. I hope to synthesize my own version of the features from `OnlineNewsPopularity.csv` as a way to explore natural language processing and feature engineering.
